### Projects(About programming)
 
**A game based on UE4 - Tofu Game!**

*Ge Gao, Matin Chang, Welly Chang, Prescott Ha*

We made this 2.5D game based on UE4, Maya and so on. The game tells about how Tofu gets away from dangerous things like fire, mouse, and the chief(our final boss!). I worked as a programmer to control triggers and AI in game, and I also worked as an artist to design models and visual effect.

**Flight Simulator in VR Environment**

*Ge Gao, Xiaoyi Huang*

We built an interactive flight simulator in VR environment using traditional input devices such as keyboard, combined with third-party input devices specifically designed for VR devices, such as LeapMotion. (Using OpenGL and GLSL)

**A research - Preferred Color of Light in Indoor Settings for Computer Generated Imagery**

*Jessica Balfe, Ge Gao, Sri Rama Kartheek Kappagantula, Yushan Wei*

We wanted to study whether warm lights are preferred in virtual indoor environment. We conducted an experiment which we showed videos(We built using Maya) to our participants, each video containing a walkthrough of an indoor room with warm white light, cool white light, dark and bright furnature. Our results indicate that majority of people prefer warm light to cool light in different conditions and that the parameters Intensity of light and color of furniture have little effect on a person’s preference for color of light.

**A C complier based on Antlr**

*Jiayuan Zhang(Leader), Ge Gao, Hongyao Huang*

We developed a complete C complier, including parse tree, intermediate code, interface design and so on.

### B.E. Thesis

**Movie Box-Office Prediction Model and Visualization Based on Big Data**

*Supervised by Dr. [Shiguang Liu](http://www.tjucs.win/faculty/lsg/) (Department of Computer Science and Technology, Tianjin University)*

I began with the visualization of movie data and analyzed the effecting factor of box-office prediction. Then I set feature factors including directors, actors, and release schedule. Based on quantifying the feature factors with the data extracted from search engine and social media, the paper established a new scientific movie box-office revenue’s prediction model using training set. All in all, this paper realized the innovation of predicting method and improved the accuracy of movie box-office revenue’s prediction compared to previous work.

### M.S. Thesis

**How People Distinguish Trees in Virtual Environment**

*Supervised by Dr. [Yingjie Chen](https://polytechnic.purdue.edu/profile/chen489), Dr. [David M Whittinghill](https://polytechnic.purdue.edu/profile/davewhit)(Department of Computer Graphics Technology, Purdue University)*

The goal of the thesis is to find out whether and to what extent people can distinguish trees with various features (relative orientation, structure, density of benches, color distribution of leaves, etc.) in virtual environment, especially real-time rendering such as game industry. During the controlled experiment, there are two research methods are used qualitatively and quantitatively. The qualitive method assesses the visually perceptual impression of interviewees on several groups of experimental materials. The quantitative method measures precise statistics on experimenting variables. The two research methods are complementary, creating a valid and comprehensive image of the experiment.
