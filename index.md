### Work Experience
![NetEase](NetEaseLogo.png) 

2017.May-2017.Aug &emsp;&emsp; I worked in **[NetEase Games](http://game.163.com/en/)** as a Senior Software Engineer Intern. I mainly did research on super-dense tree covering in 3D large scene and keeping the balance between good visual effect and well GPU performance based on PC platform and D3D9.0 API.

### Projects(About programming)
 
**A game based on UE4 - Tofu Game!**

*Ge Gao, Matin Chang, Welly Chang, Prescott Ha*

We made this 2.5D game based on UE4, Maya and so on. I worked as a programmer to control triggers and AI in game, and I also worked as an artist(I made the tableware XD).

**Flight Simulator in VR Environment**

*Ge Gao, Xiaoyi Huang*

We built an interactive flight simulator in VR environment using traditional input devices such as keyboard, combined with third-party input devices specifically designed for VR devices, such as LeapMotion. (Using OpenGL)

**A research - Preferred Color of Light in Indoor Settings for Computer Generated Imagery**

*Jessica Balfe, Ge Gao, Sri Rama Kartheek Kappagantula, Yushan Wei*

We wanted to study whether warm lights are preferred in virtual indoor environment. We conducted an experiment which we showed videos(We built using Maya) to our participants, each video containing a walkthrough of an indoor room with warm white light, cool white light, dark and bright furnature. Our results indicate that majority of people prefer warm light to cool light in different conditions and that the parameters Intensity of light and color of furniture have little effect on a person’s preference for color of light.

**Digital on-campus information platform**

*Zheng Yan(Leader), Ge Gao, Mengnan Liu, Wei Tang*

We developing a information inquiry platform based on ArcGIS and Google Maps.

**A game based on 3DsMAX and 3DS Loader - Drivering**(My first experience with game development)

*Ge Gao*

I developed a real-time rendering 3D driving game with interaction, animation, terrain, object picking, and particle effect. 

**Visualization of contour line based on MFC of VS**

*Ge Gao*

**Visualization of leaders of China and the US meeting data**

*Ge Gao*

**Image processing - Optimization of high contrasting photos**

*Ge Gao*

I realized this based on Tone Mapping algorithm.

**Image processing - Optimization of handling outliers in non-blind image deconvolution**

*Hongtao Liu(Leader), Ge Gao, Kai Liu*

We highly accelerated the processing time based on the paper, [Cho S, Wang J, Lee S. Handling outliers in non-blind image deconvolution[C]// IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision. IEEE, 2012:495-502.](https://www.computer.org/csdl/proceedings/iccv/2011/1101/00/06126280-abs.html).
