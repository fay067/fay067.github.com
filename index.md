### Work Experience
![NetEase](NetEaseLogo.png) 

2017.May-2017.Aug &emsp;&emsp; I worked in **[NetEase Games](http://game.163.com/en/)** as a Senior Software Engineer Intern. I mainly did research on super-dense tree covering in 3D large scene and keeping the balance between good visual effect and well GPU performance based on PC platform and D3D9.0 API.

### Projects
 
**A game based on UE4 - Tofu Game!**

*Ge Gao, Matin Chang, Welly Chang, Prescott Ha*

We made this game based on UE4, Maya and so on. I worked as a programmer to control triggers and AI in game, and I also worked as an artist(I made the tableware XD).

**Flight Simulator in VR Environment**

*Ge Gao, Xiaoyi Huang*

We built an interactive flight simulator in VR environment using traditional input devices such as keyboard, combined with third-party input devices specifically designed for VR devices, such as LeapMotion.
